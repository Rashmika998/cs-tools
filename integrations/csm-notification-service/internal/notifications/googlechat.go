// discoverable by key -- a real, reported bug where the later
// case.acknowledged card (which does set this same key) landed in a brand
// new thread instead of replying to this one. Setting it here unconditionally
// also means a severity change on an ordinary, already-posted case now
// threads under its case.created card too, rather than standing alone --
// REPLY_MESSAGE_FALLBACK_TO_NEW_THREAD (sendCardToAudience/postCard) still

// as a known configuration gap, not a failure: logged at warn and reported
// as a no-op success — a not-yet-onboarded team must not block or retry
// the whole delivery (other audiences still go out regardless).
//
// Every real attempt (webhook configured) logs its own outcome — success or
// failure — at this single choke point, so "did a Chat alert actually go
// out, and to which audience's space" is answerable directly from this
// service's own logs instead of only inferring it from a caller's generic
// retry/dead-letter log further up the call stack, which doesn't say which
// channel failed or why. audience is always safe to log (a team name or
// fixed constant, never recipient data); the failure log deliberately logs
// only postCard's status code, not the error itself or its message — a
// google chat error response can echo back part of the submitted card
// (title/text) verbatim, and this service's own convention is to log ids
// and sanitised summaries only, never a raw upstream body that might carry
// case content (see publishCaseCreatedEvent's identical reasoning,
// entity-service's CLAUDE.md).
//
// number/id are the case/SR/incident's own human-readable number (e.g.
// "CS0379063") and raw id (a UUID), logged on every line here alongside
// audience — every caller already has both in hand (or, for the escalation
// ladder, just a human reference — see its own call sites), so it costs
// nothing to thread them through. Added because "google chat alert sent"
// with only an audience gave no way to confirm which specific case/incident
// a given send was actually for when investigating a report that an alert
// didn't arrive; a number/id is the same class of safe-to-log value
// audience already is, never recipient data or case content. Either may be
// empty when a caller genuinely has nothing better (e.g. a card with no
// natural id of its own) — logged as an empty string, not omitted, so its
// absence is itself visible rather than silently missing from the line.
//
// alertType (derived from msg's own CardsV2[0].CardID — "case-created-alert",
// "frustration-alert", "sla-breach-alert", ... — never a second parameter
// every caller would otherwise have to pass) says WHICH kind of alert this
// was: "google chat alert sent" alone couldn't tell a routine case-created
// post apart from a frustration-detection alert for the same case, which
// matters when investigating whether a *specific* alert (not just any alert
// for that case) actually went out.
